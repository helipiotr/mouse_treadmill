CAN example

Example description
This example describes how to use CAN peripheral on LPC17xx and LPC40xx chip.
It requires a CAN analyser or, another CAN device connected to CAN_1 pins.
After initializing, the device will setup the AF Look-up table which defines
acceptable IDs. Then, it transmits first standard message with ID 0x200 on bus,
a remote message with ID 0x300 and an extended message with ID 0x10000200.
The device always listens message on the bus. Whenever a message whose ID exists in
the AF Look-up Table comes, the device will reply back a message with ID 0x200. The
data in replied message is the same with the one of received message.

AF Lookup Table:
	Full CAN Section: includes 0x03, 0x04, 0x07, 0x09.
Individual Standard ID Section: includes 0x30, 0x40, 0x50, 0x90, 0xB0.
Standard ID Range Section: includes 0x300~0x400, 0x400~0x500, 0x700~0x780.
Extended ID Section: includes 0x803, 0x804, 0x807, 0x809.
Extended ID Range Section: includes 0xB00~0xC00, 0xC00~0xD00, 0xF00~0xF80.
