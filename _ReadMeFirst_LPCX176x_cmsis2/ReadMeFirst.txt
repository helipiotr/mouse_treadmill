ReadMeFirst_LPCX176x_cmsis2
===========================

[ Note these examples are suitable for use with 
[ LPCXpresso1769 boards as well as LPCXpresso1768
[ boards.

The LPCXpresso176x_cmsis2 zip file contains a small 
set of examples produced by Code Red aimed mainly at
those who are using only the LPCXpresso processor card 
itself (without additional hardware attached). 

[Note that the EasyWeb example does require connection
 to additional hardware, such as Embedded Artists' 
 LPCXpresso baseboard to provide the ethernet interface.]
 
Thus they are largely various ways of controlling
the flashing of the LED on the board. These examples
give a good basis for initial experimentation with 
the LPCXpresso board and familarization with the Code
Red IDE, before moving onto the more complex LPCXpresso
examples produced by NXP.

Note that the version of these examples provided along
with this readme are intended for use with Red Suite /
LPCXpresso IDE v4.0 or later. Use of this project with 
earlier versions of the Code Red IDE is not recommended
or supported.
